Project Overview
In today's competitive business landscape, predicting customer churn is essential for maintaining a healthy revenue stream and enhancing customer retention strategies. This project focuses on developing a predictive model that identifies customers at risk of churning based on various features such as age, gender, tenure, usage frequency, support calls, payment delay, subscription type, contract length, and total spend.
Objectives
Predict Customer Churn: Utilize machine learning techniques to forecast which customers are likely to discontinue their service.
Data-Driven Insights: Provide actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies by identifying key factors influencing churn.
Tools Required
Python: For data processing and machine learning model development.
Power BI: For visualization and storytelling of the churn predictions.
Libraries:
Pandas for data manipulation.
Scikit-learn for building and evaluating machine learning models.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
LightGBM for efficient model training.

Created Visualizations in Power BI

Conclusion
This structured approach combines predictive analytics with business intelligence tools to analyze customer churn effectively. By implementing this project, you can leverage AI models alongside BI tools to derive actionable insights that enhance customer retention strategies. The successful prediction of customer churn not only aids in identifying at-risk customers but also enables businesses to implement proactive measures to retain them, ultimately contributing to long-term growth and profitability.
